# **Ash's Video Converter**  
*A gloriously over-engineered GUI wrapper for FFmpeg, handcrafted in Python with love.*

---

## What Is This?

**Ash’s Video Converter** is a slick, dark-themed desktop application built with PyQt5 that lets you:

- Convert *any* video format (as long as FFmpeg can read it, which is basically everything except microwave dinners)
- Change resolution with one click
- Choose your desired output file format  
  *(mp4, mkv, mov, avi, webm—because variety is the spice of life)*
- Give your output file a custom name  
  *(say goodbye to “Untitled_1_FINAL_v3_EDITED_FIXED_REALFINAL.mp4”)*
- Watch the conversion progress with a real progress bar
- Spy on FFmpeg’s inner thoughts with a scrolling log window
- Enjoy a slick, dark navy theme and pretend you're hacker man! 

#### This is the “I’m too lazy to remember FFmpeg arguments” tool we all need.

## Features

### **Accepts Any Input Video Format**
If FFmpeg can read it, this GUI can handle it.  
.avi? .mov? .mk4? .flv? Some obscure container from 2004?  
Yep. Bring it on.

### **Pick Your Output Format**
Choose between:

- **mp4**
- **mkv**
- **mov**
- **avi**
- **webm**

Convert your shaky phone video into something your editing software actually likes.

### **Choose Your Resolution**
From glorious Full HD to "why does this look like it was filmed with a potato":

- 1920×1080  
- 1280×720  
- 854×480  
- 640×360  
- 426×240

### **Custom Output File Name**
Name it whatever you want.  
You’re in control.  
You’re powerful.  
You’ve always been powerful.

### **Progress Bar + Status Updates**
No more staring at a terminal wondering whether something is happening or whether FFmpeg has died again.  
This GUI tracks real conversion progress using ffprobe + ffmpeg timecodes.

### **Full Log Window**
See *everything* FFmpeg says in real time.  
Useful for debugging…  
…or for pretending you’re in a cyberpunk thriller.

### **Dark Navy Theme**
Your retinas will thank you.  
Cool, modern, professional, and just a little bit moody.

Windows users: add ffmpeg/bin to your PATH

macOS users: brew install ffmpeg

Linux users: you know what you’re doing

## Installation
Clone or download this repository

### Install the requirements:

 
pip install PyQt5  

### Ensure FFmpeg is working:  
ffmpeg -version  


### Run the app:  
python resize.py  
## Boom. You're in.  


## Final Thoughts
This project exists because manually typing FFmpeg commands is character-building,
but sometimes you just want to press a button and feel like royalty. Also I prefer to sped hours writing a script than just spending 10 minutes doing it the normal way...

If this made your life easier, even once, it has served its noble purpose.

# Enjoy converting!
